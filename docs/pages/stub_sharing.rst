Sharing Stubs
*************

Stub-O-Matic allows stubs to be organised and shared in ways to suit a project's
test data needs. Stubo is about emulating back-end system behaviour and as such,
stubs can be organised around individual services provided by a given back-end 
service. These stubs can be assembled and re-used as required by individual tests.

Another option is for each test to own its own stubs. This  makes each test and
its data independent from all others, but can also lead to an explosion of stubs and
potential management issues if they need to be upgraded to changes in the 
back-end system.

As an example, consider an end to end use case for a Game Leader application as follows:
Test 4 - Change leader

GIVEN current (10 July) leader is Bob

WHEN current leader is requested

THEN leader is Bob

WHEN Sue enters a score of 1000 for 10 July

WHEN current leader is requested

THEN leader is now Sue

This test uses both the increment_score service and the view_leader service.
Many stubs from the other tests can be reused and will be by creating a new command
file.

Stubo command files can use stubs from folders relative to the command file location
or by URL. Refer to the 'Commands' section of this documentation for details.

These stubs and command files show how Stubo can mingle stubs provided at a service 
function level with stubs specific to a given test.
