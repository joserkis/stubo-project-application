Stub-O-Matic supports functional, performance and load testing. The two (opposing) goals regarding performance are:

1. Scalability : the ability to support hundreds or thousands of concurrent stub requests without impacting performance
2. Configurable delays on stub requests to emulate response times of the systems being stubbed

Efficient use of hardware.

* Test teams can share a StuboNG server and by using different URLs for the server essentially have their own virtual 
Stubo instance.
